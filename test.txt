Jesus Calls the First Disciples
35 The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples, 36 and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!” 37 The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus. 38 Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, "What are you seeking?” And they said to him, "Rabbi” (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?” 39 He said to them, "Come and you will see.” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.[j] 40 One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus[k] was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 41 He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, "We have found the Messiah” (which means Christ). 42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas” (which means Peter[l]).

Jesus Calls Philip and Nathanael
43 The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, "Follow me.” 44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 45 Philip found Nathanael and said to him, "We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” 46 Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, "Come and see.” 47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!” 48 Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?” Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” 49 Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” 50 Jesus answered him, "Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.” 51 And he said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you,[m] you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”

We have argued that the existence of God cannot be falsified, and that the claim "God exists” is hence meaningless. We can object that there are quite a number of feelings linked to God: When we pray, we feel better; when we believe that God protects us, we feel relieved; when something good happens, we feel thankful. Are these not real, perceptual experiences? And can these experiences not be predicted by the assumption of God? And if yes, does this not give "God” a meaning, in the sense that the hypothesis of God has predictive power?
These experiences are indeed perceptions in the sense of this book. Thus, the theory "If I pray to God, I feel relieved” does make falsifiable predictions. These predictions are well studied, and the present book dedicates a section to them.
However, such theories always concern an action by the believer — and never an action by the god. It is the belief in God, the prayer to God, or the devotion that has the effect — and never the god himself, but always of the form "If I do X with respect to God, then.It follows that such theories can only ever predict psychological experiences. They can predict feelings of relief, the illusion of control, or the abatement of fear. However, they cannot predict that God created the universe, that we have to follow his commandments, or that he has objective physical existence. Thus, "God” is an auxiliary notion that we use to describe our subjective psychological experiences. In this sense, God exists. But he exists only in our heads.

We have argued that the hypothesis "God exists” cannot be falsified. Therefore, atheism holds that gods are the work of fiction. Now how about atheism? Can the claim "God does not exist” be falsified?
To answer this question, we have to find things that we would count as proofs that God exists. Here is a list of things that atheists would accept as a proof that God exists:
Praying to God makes things possible that are otherwise impossible
God reveals himself in a scientifically verifiable way
God intervenes in this world a verifiable and identifiable way
All of these things would be proofs that God exists. Hence, the claim "God does not exist” is falsifiable. This makes the claim meaningful. Its meaning is: None of the above things will ever happen. The claim predicts that, no matter how much we pray, we will never obtain anything that would not happen anyway. Praying, observing rites, or following superstitions will never have any effect other than psychological. This is indeed what we find. The claim also predicts that no god will ever reveal himself in a scientifically verifiable way. Again, this is what we find. Finally, the claim predicts that no god will ever intervene in this world in a way that we can identify him. In other words: There are no miracles. Again, this is what we observe. Thus, the claim is not only meaningful, but also correct. It makes concrete and true predictions about the real world. This is more than any religion can say of itself.
This is the central asymmetry between theism and atheism: Theism says there is a god, but does not say what will happen or not happen. Hence, theism is not falsifiable and thus meaningless. Atheism says there is no god, and uses this to make predictions — which we find to be true.

Interestingly, as soon as God intervenes in this world in a verifiable way, he ceases to be supernatural. Thus, atheists could start believing in his existence, but still reject the supernatural. Thus, they would remain atheists. It’s just that they would start believing in that god, because that god ceased to be supernatural
